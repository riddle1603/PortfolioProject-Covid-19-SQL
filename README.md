# PortfolioProject-Covid-19-SQL
In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 datasets using SQL. The analysis focuses on total cases vs. deaths, infection rates by population, vaccination progress, and country-level comparisons. This project demonstrates practical SQL skills including joins, CTEs, subqueries, window functions, and data filtering.
